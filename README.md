# EDA-for-IBM-Sales-Data-Set-2004-2007
I was accepted into the LearnIT Girl progam where I was paired with a mentor so I could learn Python. My mentor Nirvi is a Data Scientist and introduced me to Data Science by providing me with the following URL https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/retail-sales-marketing-profit-cost/.
She asked me to perform and EDA which was my first time hearing the term. She gave me this article for me to review: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis
This is the result.
